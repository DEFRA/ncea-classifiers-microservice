In the sublittoral, surface abrasion is likely to result from pots or creels, cables and chains associated with fixed gears and moorings, anchoring of recreational vessels, objects placed on the seabed such as the legs of jack-up barges, and harvesting of seaweeds (e.g. kelps) or other intertidal species (trampling) or of epifaunal species (e.g. oysters). In sublittoral habitats, passing bottom gear (e.g. rock hopper gear) may also cause surface abrasion to epifaunal and epifloral communities, including epifaunal biogenic reef communities. Activities associated with surface abrasion can cover relatively large spatial areas e.g. bottom trawls or bio-prospecting or be relatively localized activities e.g. seaweed harvesting, recreation, potting, and aquaculture.', 'lv2-015', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

This pressure is associated with activities such as anchoring, taking of sediment/geological cores, cone penetration tests, cable burial (ploughing or jetting), propeller wash from vessels, and certain fishing activities, e.g. scallop dredging, and beam trawling. Agitation dredging, where sediments are deliberately disturbed by gravity & hydraulic dredging where sediments are deliberately disturbed and moved by currents could also be associated with this pressure type. Compression of sediments, e.g. from the legs of a jack-up barge could also fit into this pressure type. Abrasion relates to the damage of the sea bed surface layers (typically up to 50 cm depth). Activities associated with abrasion can cover relatively large spatial areas and include fishing with towed demersal trawls (fish & shellfish); bio-prospecting such as harvesting of biogenic features such as maerl beds where, after extraction, conditions for recolonization remain suitable or relatively localised activities including seaweed harvesting, recreation, potting, aquaculture. Change from gravel to silt substrata would adversely affect herring spawning grounds.
Loss, removal or modification of the substratum is not included within this pressure (see the physical loss pressure theme).

It can result in short-lived sediment concentration gradients and the accumulation of sediments on the sea floor. This accumulation of sediments is synonymous with "light" smothering, which relates to the depth of vertical overburden. “Light” smothering relates to the deposition of layers of sediment on the seabed. It is associated with activities such as sea disposal of dredged materials where sediments are deliberately deposited on the sea bed. For “light” smothering most benthic biota may be able to adapt, i.e. vertically migrate through the deposited sediment.
“Heavy” smothering also relates to the deposition of layers of sediment on the seabed but is associated with activities such as sea disposal of dredged materials where sediments are deliberately deposited on the sea bed. This accumulation of sediments relates to the depth of vertical overburden where the sediment type of the existing and deposited sediment has similar physical characteristics because, although most species of marine biota are unable to adapt, e.g. sessile organisms unable to make their way to the surface, a similar biota could, with time, re-establish.
